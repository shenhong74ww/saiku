1. Forked from [Saiku](https://github.com/OSBI/saiku) and modified some pom.xml files.

2. Added license.lic from [saiku-fix](https://github.com/ambientelivre/saiku-fix) at the root folder.

3. Download [saiku-server](https://github.com/OSBI/saiku/issues/736) from the first link since community version download page cannot be opened. You can find the jar that cannot be downloaded in `saiku-server\tomcat\webapps\saiku\WEB-INF\lib`.
